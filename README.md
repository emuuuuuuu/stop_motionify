# stop_motionify


Most tutorials on making 3D animation look like stop motion boil down to exporting to 12 fps or animating on 2's; however, not all stop motion movies are animated on 2's. "Coraline" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas" are both animated on 1's. This script aims to make smooth interpolated animation or motion capture animation have some of the imperfections that make stop motion unique, without resorting to animating on 2's. Essentially, this add-on removes the very subtle movements that a stop motion animator realistically wouldn't be able to do or be bothered to do. The bones only move when there is exaggerated movement. 

To use it, download the .py file and drop install it and activate it in preferences as with any other add-on. Select your armature (make sure its animation is baked) and hit "Apply". The strength of the effect can be adjusted using the strength parameter.
